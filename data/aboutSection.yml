  ### I design and build data analytics & data science products.

  I love learning new tools and skills. My passion is working with R. But, when I am not working on scripts for MTG BAN or ETL projects for Ad.Net, I enjoy watching hockey & playing with my dachshunds.
  
  
  My area of focus is applying data analytics to business. I create value for companies by understanding & identifying road blocks and repetitive tasks, and in turn, building automated solutions that generate long term value. I enjoy communicating with all stakeholders to make better decisions with data.
